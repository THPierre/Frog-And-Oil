# Frog-And-Oil
Frog And Oil is a school project made in my first year of degree, among a team of 8 student.

I was in charge of the UI integration and menus, especially the main menu, wich features dynamic camera moves between differents points of view according to the button
you clicked.

About the Main Menu

Using empty gameobjects as waypoints, the code is a simple interpolation of the camera between two waypoints.
The Main menu features several sub menus, such as an option menu, a credits menu, a quit and play confirmation menu,
and 3 sub categories for the options menu : a Sound, Video and controls sub menus.

About the Game

Frog and Oil is a Shoot'em up where you play as a robotic frog, controlled by a bunch of carnivors plants, attacked by differents insects species, 
in a world devasted by pollution. The plants controls the robotic frog to move in the world and shoot toxic waste at ennemy insects.

The game also features a parkour level where the frog needs to avoid approaching props that cannot be destroyed by bullets. When you succeed that level, 
you need to fight the insect king, the game ends when you kill it.
